This project computes a **Business Conditions Index (BCI)** for the U.S. economy using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** on macroeconomic indicators from the **FRED-QD** dataset. Inspired by academic and Federal Reserve research, this index provides a transparent, reproducible tool for summarizing the U.S. business cycle from a large number of indicators.

## 🧠 Methodology: PCA and Business Cycle Tracking

This index uses **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to extract a common factor from a panel of macroeconomic indicators — a technique rooted in econometrics and commonly used in empirical macroeconomic research.

### 📐 Mathematical Framework

Let **X** be a matrix of standardized, stationary macroeconomic variables:

- Each column is a variable (e.g. GDP, CPI, unemployment)
- Each row is a time period (quarter)

We compute a linear combination:

```
z = X·w
```

that maximizes the variance of `z`, subject to the constraint:

```
maximize Var(X·w)
subject to ‖w‖ = 1
```

This gives a **single latent factor** — the first principal component — that captures the **largest common variation** across all included economic series.

---

### 🔁 Data Transformations

- All input series are made **stationary** using transformations (e.g. first differences, log-differences)
- The resulting series are **standardized** to mean 0 and unit variance
- PCA is applied on the cleaned and standardized matrix

---

### 🔄 Sign Convention

To make the index intuitive:
- If the PCA output is **negatively correlated** with real GDP (`GDPC1`), we **flip the sign**
- This ensures that **positive values of the index imply above-average economic activity**, and vice versa

---

### 📈 Interpretation

The resulting **Business Conditions Index (BCI)**:
- Is centered around 0
- Moves up during expansions and down during recessions
- Can be interpreted similarly to the Chicago Fed’s [CFNAI](https://www.chicagofed.org/research/data/cfnai/current-data)

---

### 💡 Academic Background

This technique was taught by **Professor Joshua Chan** (Purdue University) as part of the graduate Machine Learning II course. It is frequently used in empirical macroeconomics to capture the cyclical component of large datasets with a single, interpretable index.

---

## 📊 Key Features

- Uses 20+ macroeconomic time series from FRED-QD (GDP, CPI, Retail Sales, etc.)
- Automatically standardizes and stationarizes data
- Performs PCA and dynamically flips sign for economic interpretability
- Visualizes the index over time, including zoomed views and tooltips
- Includes variable descriptions and CSV download for further analysis

## 🚀 Deployment

This app is live on **Streamlit Community Cloud**:  
🌐 [business-conditions-index.streamlit.app](https://business-conditions-index.streamlit.app/)

### ✅ Option 1: Deploy Your Own (Streamlit Cloud)

1. Fork or clone this repo to your own GitHub
2. Go to [streamlit.io/cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) and click **“New App”**
3. Configure the deployment:
   - **Repository:** `your-username/business-conditions-index`
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Main file:** `bci.py`
4. Streamlit automatically uses the `environment.yml` file to install dependencies.
